1️⃣ Upload PDFs

What happens

The user uploads one or more PDF files from the Streamlit UI.

Why

These PDFs are your knowledge base.

The LLM (Llama 3) cannot read PDFs directly.


2️⃣ Extract Text from PDFs

What happens

Each PDF is read page by page using PyPDF2.

Text is extracted and merged into one large string.

Why

LLMs and embedding models only understand text, not PDF files


3️⃣ Chunk the Text

What happens

The large text is split into small overlapping chunks

Why

Embedding models have input limits.

Smaller chunks improve retrieval accuracy.

Overlap preserves context between chunks.



4️⃣ Generate Embeddings (mxbai-embed-large)

What happens

Each text chunk is converted into a vector (numbers) using:

Why

Vectors allow semantic search.

Similar meaning → vectors close together.

Important

❌ Llama 3 cannot generate embeddings

✅ mxbai-embed-large is designed for embeddings



5️⃣ Build Vector Index (FAISS)

What happens

All embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector index.

Vectors are normalized and indexed for fast similarity search.

Why

FAISS enables instant retrieval even with thousands of chunks.

Uses cosine similarity (via inner product).



7️⃣ Embed the Question

What happens

The user question is converted into an embedding using the same model.

Why

Question and document chunks must be in the same vector space.


8️⃣ Retrieve Relevant Chunks (Top-K)

What happens

FAISS searches for the Top-K most similar chunks.

Why

Only the most relevant document parts are passed to Llama 3.

Reduces hallucination.


9️⃣ Build Prompt with Context

What happens

Retrieved chunks are injected into the prompt as context.

Why

This is what makes it Retrieval-Augmented Generation.


🔟 Generate Answer (Llama 3)

What happens

Llama 3 generates the final answer using:

User question

Retrieved document context

Why

Llama 3 reasons + explains

Documents provide ground truth


1️⃣1️⃣ Display Answer + History

What happens

Answer is shown in the UI.

Question + answer saved in session state.

Why

Enables chat-like experience.

Easy to extend to multi-turn memory later.
